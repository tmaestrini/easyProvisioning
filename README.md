# easyProvisioning â€“ resource provisioning made as easy as possible
*easyProvisioning* offers a quick and easy way to provision site resources and a range of predefined assets in SharePoint Online (SPO). By defining a YAML template that contains all the information about the desired site resources, this method is both a straightforward approach to provisioning and also serves as documentation for the provisioned resources.

Under the hood, the provisioning engine is powered by the PnP.Powershell module and the PnPProvisioning concept. This provides us with a powerful toolset for setting up and managing all resources that need to be provisioned within M365.

Give it a try â€“Â I'm sure you will have fun! ðŸ’ª

ðŸ‘‰ SPO is currently the only targeted service in M365 â€“ but other services 
will follow asap. Any contributors are welcome! ðŸ™Œ
